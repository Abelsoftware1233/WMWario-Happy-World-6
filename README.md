How to play? 🕹
The game starts with the cards face down and shuffled. Your goal is to click on a card and memorize its appearance. When you click on two matching cards, they unlock and stay face up. Unlock all cards to win the game.

Rules 🧩
Clear Objective: Click on the cards and find their pairs, thus training your memory.

Lives: The player has no lives; they can make several mistakes.

The End?: Have you unlocked all the cards? Then it's the end.

Desktop 💻✔
Click on the cards with your mouse or touch.

Mobile 📱❌|✔
Vertical: Not available.👻


Horizontal: Available

Mobile Responsiveness 📱
For devices with a width below 650, unfortunately, the layout becomes distorted.

Oops! ಥ_ಥ

It seems your electronic device does not support the necessary screen size to 'run' the game without layout distortions.

I apologize, but for the moment, this service for mobile will be unavailable.
'AN ALTERNATIVE IS TO ROTATE YOUR DEVICE'.
Rotating the screen is an option to access the game layout.
